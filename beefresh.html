  <div class="overview-p">
    <h1 class="header-title">Overview</h1>
<p>  As part of the UBC Ennovate Business Foundations Mentorship Program, I co-founded and led all marketing and communications for our student start-up, BeeFresh. BeeFresh Candles are candles are made up of a beeswax and soy mix to purify the home. It is a natural alternative to commercial candles, which typically contain toxic chemicals that can damage our health. For marketing, we promoted on Facebook and Instagram, as well as a website I built using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Overall, we raised $375 from this initiative that were then donated to the David Suzuki Foundation. BeeFresh Candles won the top prize of 'Most Ennovative Award' for excellence in all areas including proceeds raised, marketing, operations, and relevancy at the UBC Ennovate Final Competition.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4 black">The Product</h1>
   <p> Candles can be found in almost every home and for the usual purpose of filling the space with aromatic scents or creating a relaxing ambience through the soft glow of the light. However, most commercialized candles are made of paraffin wax, which creates highly toxic carcinogens when burned. That‚Äôs where BeeFresh comes in. We saw an opportunity to improve on this simple and common household product by creating a more eco-friendly alternative that benefits the consumers and the environment. Thus, BeeFresh was born not to be a common household product, but out of the need for more sustainable products in the market with an emphasis on mental and physical health. Through our beeswax and soy wax candles infused with essential oils, we were still able to provide consumers with the common purposes of a candle while enhancing it with added health benefits. </p>

 <p>Passionate about caring for this planet, we upcycled donated glass jars to use as containers for our candles. These jars primarily came from our personal network and community donors and were typically previously used as baby food or yogurt jars. </p>
<p>
All ingredients are 100% natural and sourced locally, meaning they don‚Äôt harm the environment when they‚Äôre created and burned. 100% of our profits were donated to the David Suzuki Foundation, an organization dedicated to slowing down climate change and creating a greener country.</p>

<h4>Screenshots of a results from a product market research survey I conducted for students in high-school and university.</h4>
<p>At BeeFresh, we place a high value on our customers. With scents that help to reduce anxiety and improve moods, we aim to provide the best values possible for our customers. This was decided when conducting our original market research survey to test for interest in our product. When asked what aspects of personal health people were interested in improving, we found that 97% of people were interested in reducing their stress/anxiety, with 87% interest in improving mood and 79% interested in increasing focus (Appendix A). This survey spanned a sample size of approximately 40 people, and hearing input from our demographic helped us curate the ideal product for them. In order to incentivize participation in this survey, we offered the opportunity for participants to gain 10 extra entries to a giveaway we were hosting at the time as well. </p>
